    floating point division: /
    remainder: %
    exponentiation: **

Evaluate the following Python3 expressions. Expressions similar to these could be asked.

    4 - 2 * 1 = 2
    1 + 2 ** 3 = 9
    7 // 2 = 3
    'hello'[0:2] = 'he'
    range(0, 4) = range(0, 4)
    '3' + '2' =
    int('3') + int('2') = 5
    '3' * 2 = 33
    'Hello'.upper() = 'HELLO'
    len('hi there') = 8

Basic Python Programs

Write a complete and correct Python3 program to do the following. Programs of similar complexity as these could be asked.

    Print the integers from 1 to 10 along with those numbers squared.
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i, i**2)

    Take two integers as input from the user and print a rectangle of *'s with those dimensions.
    import argparse
    import sys

    height = int(sys.argv[1])
    width = int(sys.argv[2])

    i = 0;
    while i < height:
        print('*'*width)
        i += 1

    Ask the user for the answer. If they type "42", print "but what is the question.". If they don't type "42" ask again, and keep asking until they type "42".
    answer = 0
    while answer != 42:
        answer = int(input("What is the answer?\n"))
        if answer == 42:
            question = 0;
            while question != 42:
                question = int(input("But what is the question?\n"))

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(2**i)

Play Computer

Write down all variables in each of the following programs and keep track of their values as well as what is printed on the screen. Programs of similar complexity as these could be asked.

def fun(n):
  if n <= 0: return
  print(n)
  fun(n//2)
fun(42)

printed out:
42
21
10
5
2
1

n = 42

for i in range(0, 5):
  for j in range(i, 5):
    print('x'*j)

printed out:
x
xx
xxx
xxxx
x
xx
xxx
xxxx
xx
xxx
xxxx
xxx
xxxx
xxxx

i = 4, j = 4

L = 'what is the meaning of this?'.split()
for x in L:
  print(x, 'a' in x)

printed out:
what True
is False
the False
meaning True
of False
this? False

L = ['what', 'is', 'the', 'meaning', 'of', 'this?']

Math

Complete each of the following math rules.

    2a+b =
    ya * yb =
    logbx = y, means:
    logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y)
    Arithmetic Sum: (1 + 2 + ... + n) = n 8 (n+1) / 2
    not (A and B) is equivalent to: (not A) or (not B)

CS Terms

What is the definition of each of the following.

    bit: smallest unit of digital data
