CS 458/558 Assignment 1 
1. Write pseudocode for finding distance that prints the corresponding path between two given 
vertices u, v of input digraph G. (No weights on the arcs) (10 points) 

stack = []
visited = []

DFS(u, v):
    stack.append(u)
    if(u == v):
        print(stack)
        return
    visited.add(u)

    if(u has any children):
        for( all children in u):
            if(child has been visited):
                DFS(child, v)
    stack.pop()


 
2. Write pseudocode for finding the longest path between two given vertices u, v of input digraph 
G. (15 points) 

maxPath = []
maxLength, length = 0, 0


LongestPath(u, v, current, length)
    if(current == v):
        if(length > maxLength)
            maxPath = path
            maxLength = length
        return;
    
    for every arc(current, w)
        if w not in path:
            add w to path
            LongestPath(u, v, w, length+1)
            remove w from path
    
 
3. Let G be a digraph. Design an algorithm that finds a shortest cycle in G. (10 points) 

n = number of vertices
vertices[all graph vertices] // fill list with all vertices of graph
minCycle = vertices // default minCycle to highest (theoreticaly) possible

for vertex in vertices:
    BFS(G, vertex)

        length = 1
        u = vertex
        Q = [] //queue
        visited = []

        Q.add(u) // start by adding u into queue until neighbors are marked

        visited.add(u)

        while (Q.length > 0) //while the queue is not empty
            i = Q.pop() // remove u from queue and set i as a temp u to search its neighbors

            for (all neighbors) j of i in G:
                if(j not in visited)
                    Q.add(j)    //add j to queue to later visit its neighbors (just as we did with u in the beginning)
                    j.visited = true
                    length += 1
                else: //if we have visited the current node/vertex before, leave the loop (because we completed a cycle)
                    if(visited.length < minCycle.length): // if the cycles length is less than our minumun, set it as new min
                        minCycle = visited
                    return;

 
4. Let G be a digraph. Design an algorithm that finds a longest cycle in G. (15 points) 
dfs?


Similar answer to 2, but instead of v, make way back to u

maxPath = []
maxLength, length = 0, 0


LongestPath(u,  current, length)
    if(current == u):
        if(length > maxLength)
            maxPath = path
            maxLength = length
        return;
    
    for every arc(current, w)
        if w not in path:
            add w to path
            LongestPath(u, w, length+1)
            remove w from path
    

 
5. Let T be a tree with at least two vertices. Prove that T has at least two leaves. (10 points) 

Tree with n vertices = tree with n-1 edges
Let d(n) be the degree of n.

Suppose you have a maximal path, P in T. Suppose u and v are the end vertices of P. The only possible neighbor of u would be the vertex adjacent to it in P
(otherwise the path would contain a cycle). Thus, the degree of u is equal to one (d(u) = 1) making u a leaf. By the same argument, d(v) = 1.
Thus, with any tree with vertices greater than 2, there must be at least two leaves.
 
6. Write a program (you can use lecture notes) that reads n and k â‰¤ n and prints all permutations of 
1, 2, ..., n in which exactly k elements are fixed (k elements are in their positions). (10 points) 

ex: n = 3, k = 1

123 X (3 > k)
132 O (1 in correct point)
231 X (0 < k)
213 O (3 in correct point)
312 X (0 < k)
321 O (2 in correct point)

Solution:
n = input(), k = input()

if(k > n)
    return;
