Q: Consider the relation scheme R(C,S,Z) with the following set of functional dependencies: { CS --> Z, Z --> C}.

(a) Is R in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) ?

(b) Is R in Third Normal Form (3NF) ?

BCNF (simplified): [Key -> Key or Non-Key]
BCNF Formal: With the exception of trivial functional dependencies, every functional
dependency in a table must be a dependency on a candidate Key
(or on a superset of a candidate key)

Primary Keys: CS

CS -> Z, Key -> Non-Key = BCNF
Z -> C, Non-Key -> Key =\= BCNF 
S -> CS Key -> Key
C -> CSZ Key -> Key

(a) R is not in BCNF. This is because of the functional dependency of Z -> C,
with C not being a candidate key (at least by itself)

(b) R is in Third Normal Form, because every non-prime key is dependent on a candidate key.

S -> CS
C -> CSV
z -> CS
